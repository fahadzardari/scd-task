# Git Process used
First we create this repo and added all of the group members as collaborators, this was done to give each and everyone owner privileges.

Every group member created branches for their features and upon completion a PR was created to merge all the changes with main branch.

All the common and important features of GIT have been utilized in this project i.e branching , stashing , merge conflict , collobaration. 

(None of the branches used have been deleted)
